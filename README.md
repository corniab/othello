# Othello
## Description
Reversi or its modern variant Othello is a strategy board game played on a 8x8 board.[^1] 
Two players take turns outflanking each other until neither one has a valid move.

## Purpose
This project has a two-fold purpose. The first purpose was to learn the basics of a statically 
typed language. The second purpose was to learn recursive search.

I was asked to code the logic for this game in a coding interview and I failed miserably!
After musing over my performance, I identified that the solution to the problem was to use
recursive search. After diving in and learning everything I could about the topic,
I decided to write my own version of the game in Java.

This is my first foray into a statically typed language which has been simultaneously a
blessing and a curse. One of the things I admire about Java is that it forces me think 
about how I write my code which always improves my output. This project represents my best
efforts to learn a new language and apply it to solve a novel (to me) problem.

## Software Demonstration

## Development Environment
- The program is written in Java 19.[^2]
- This project was developed in JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA.[^3]
- Currently, this program runs best in Windows Powershell.


## Future Work
- Improve code separation particularly in Player class
- Decouple the user input from the Game class.
- Make it clear the console in bash.
